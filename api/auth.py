    CsrfViewMiddleware (nothing here reads the session or a cookie) and a
    wrong-method request reaches the JSON 405 rather than Django's CSRF page.
    The scheme is case-insensitive (RFC 7235). With no tokens configured nothing gets
    in. The refusal names no reason, and neither it nor anything here logs
    the header (config.middleware.RequestLogMiddleware logs the request line,
    without a query string or headers). Only GET, after the token: anything
    else is a JSON 405, not Django's HTML one.

    Before the token is looked at, each request counts against a per-address
    limit (API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE), so guessing a token is slowed too.
